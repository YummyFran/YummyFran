## About Me

I am a passionate React developer with a keen eye for crafting beautiful and interactive user interfaces. Ever since I discovered React, I have been captivated by its power to build dynamic web applications and provide seamless user experiences.

## Tech Stack

- **Front-end:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/ES6.
- **State Management:** Redux, Tanstack/React Query.
- **UI Libraries:** Material-UI, Chakra UI, Shad CN.
- **Tools:** Git, Webpack, Babel.

## Projects

Here are some of the React projects I've worked on:

1. [CatLand](https://yummyfran.github.io/catland/) - Cat Land is a project that displays informations about different cat breeds. This was my first React project that uses React Router and API calls.
2. [iPlay](http://yummyfran.github.io/iPlay) - iPlay is my clone version of the mobile application "WePlay". It uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore for user data handling.
3. [islander](http://yummyfran.github.io/islander) - islander is a 3D simple game that has procedural map generation and a controllable character. However game loops isn't applied.
4. [Tic Tac Toe AI](https://yummyfran.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe---Isometric-UI/) - This is pure JavaScript game I made years ago. It is just a normal tictactoe game with a 3D feels and an artificial intelligence.
5. [Oishibot - GPT](https://github.com/YummyFran/oishibot-gtp4-powered-v2) - A Node.js project that uses OpenAiAPI. It doesn't have much features as GPT does the thing.

## React Philosophy

I firmly believe in writing clean, modular, and maintainable code. React's component-based architecture allows me to build reusable and efficient components, leading to a more organized and scalable codebase.

## Learning and Growth

As a dedicated React enthusiast, I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest React advancements and best practices. Currently, I'm focusing on using React in 3D games. My current ongoing personal project is called "islander" that has procedural map generation using perlin's noise, sprite movements in react which uses keyboard events in good performance.

## Interests

When I'm not coding with React, you can find me spending time with myself and family or I might be watching an anime. Balancing work, family, and hobbies, helps me stay inspired and creative.
